1. Consider the projection map `$p : S^1 \to [-1, 1]$`, `$p(x, y) = x$`. Prove or disprove that the point `$1 \in [-1, 1]$` has an evenly covered neighbourhood for $p$.

2. Prove or disprove: given `$\epsilon > 0$`, there exists a sequence of __closed__ subsets `$J_1, J_2, \dots, J_n\subset S^2$` of the $2$-sphere `$S^2$` with the following properties.
    1. $J_i$ has diameter less that $\epsilon$ for all $i$, `$1 \leq i \leq n$`.
    2. `$\bigcup_{i = 1}^n J_i = S^2$`.
    3. Each set `$J_i$` is connected.
    4. `$J_{k+1}\cap \bigcup_{i = 1}^k J_i$` is connected for all `$k$`, `$1 < k \leq n$`.

3. Let `$\alpha: [0, 1]\to S^1$` be a path and let `$\widetilde{\alpha'}, \widetilde{\alpha''}: [0, 1]\to \mathbb{R}$` be two lifts of `$\alpha$` with respect to the usual covering map. Then prove or disprove that the function `$\Phi: [0, 1]\to \mathbb{R}$` given by `$\Phi(t) = \widetilde{\alpha'}(t) - \widetilde{\alpha''}(t)$` must be a constant function.
