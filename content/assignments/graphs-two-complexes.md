1. An edge path of length between distinct vertices `$p$` and `$q$` of a graph `$\Gamma$` is said to be _minimal_ if every edge path between `$p$` and `$q$`   in has length at least k. Prove or disprove the following.
    * __(a)__ Every minimal path is reduced.
    * __(b)__ Every reduced path is minimal.

2. Let `$\Gamma$` be a graph that contains no (non-constant) reduced loops. Prove or disprove that its geometric realization `$|\Gamma|$` is homotopy equivalent to a discrete topological space.

3. Let `$X$` be a topological space obtained by attaching a finite number of $1$-cells to a torus. Prove or disprove the following.
    * __(a)__ `$X$` must be path-connected.
    * __(b)__ `$X$` must be simply-connected.
    * __(c)__ `$X$` cannot be simply-connected.

4. Let `$X$` be the topological space obtained byattaching two 2-cells to the circle,
with the attaching maps `$z\mapsto z^2$` and `$z\mapsto z^3$`, respectively.
Determine the fundamental group of `$X$`.
