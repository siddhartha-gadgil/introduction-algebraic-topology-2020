1. Let `$f: (X, x_0)\to (Y, y_0)$` be a map between based topological spaces and
let `$f_*: \pi_1(X, x_0)\to \pi_1(Y, y_0)$` be the induced map on fundamental groups.
Prove or disprove the following statements:
    * __(a)__ If `$f$` is injective then so is `$f_*$`.
    * __(b)__ If `$f$` is surjective then so is `$f_*$`.
    * __(c)__ If `$f$` is a homeomorphism then `$f_*$` is an isomorphism.

2. For each of the following subsets of the $2$-sphere `$S^2 = \{(x, y, z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\}$`, prove or disprove that $S^2$ retracts onto the given subset. __Note:__ we __do not__ mean _deformation retracts_.
    * __(a)__ The north pole `$N = \{(0, 0, 1)\}$`
    * __(b)__ The equator `E = $\{(x, y, 0)\in \mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2  = 1\}$`.
    * __(c)__ The closed northern hemisphere `$H = \{(x, y, z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, z \geq 0\}$`
