1. Prove or disprove: the free group on the empty set is the trivial group.

2. Let `$S$` be a set and let `$W$` be the group of finite words in `$S$`, i.e., `$$W = \{(x_1, \dots, x_n): n\geq 0, x_i\in W\ \forall i\}$$` and define
a binary operation $*$ on `$W$` by `$$(x_1, \dots, x_n) * (y_1, \dots, y_m) = (x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m) .$$` Prove or disprove the following.
    * __(a)__ `$(W, *)$` is a Semigroup.
    * __(b)__ `$(W, *)$` is a Monoid.
    * __(c)__ `$(W, *)$` is a Group.

3. Given a set `$S$`, consider words in `$W = S\cup \bar{S}$` as in the construction of the free group, with the given equivalence relation. Show that every word is equivalent to a _reduced word_.
