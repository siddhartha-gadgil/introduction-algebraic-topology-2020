1. Let `$G$` be a group. Prove or disprove that the free product `$G * \{e\}$` is isomorphic to `$G$`.
2. Let `$G = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) *(\mathbb{ Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$`. Prove or disprove that `$G$` contains a subgroup of finite index isomorphic to `$\mathbb{Z}$`.
3. Suppose the topological space `$X$` is the union of two path-connected open subsets  whose intersection is simply-connected and each of which has fundamental group isomorphic to `$\mathbb{Z}$`. Prove or disprove that the fundamental group of `$X$` must be isomorphic to the free group on two generators.
