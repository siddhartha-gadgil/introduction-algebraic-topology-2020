1. Fix a space $X$ and consider the relation on $X$ where points $p$ and $q$ are related if and only if there is an injective, continuous function $f : [0, 1] \to X$ such that $f(0) = p$ and $f(1) = q$. For each of the following properties for this relation, prove or disprove that the property must hold.
    * __(a)__ Refelexivity.
    * __(b)__ Symmetry.
    * __(c)__ Transitivity.

2. Fix a topological space X. Given a homotopy `$H: [0,1]\times [0, 1]\to X$`, we get a function `$\varphi_H$` to the space of functions `$X^{[0, 1]} = \{f: [0, 1]\to X\}$`
from the interval to X with the __product topology__ given by `$$\varphi_H(t) = s \mapsto H(s, t).$$` Prove or disprove the following statements.
    * __(a)__ If `$H$` is continuous then `$\varphi_H$` must be continuous.
    * __(b)__ If `$\varphi_H$` is continuous then `$H$` must be continuous.
