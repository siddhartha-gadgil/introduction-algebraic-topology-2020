1. For the topological space `$$X=\{(x, y)\in\mathbb{R}^2: x\in\mathbb{Q} \textrm{ or }y=0\},$$` prove or disprove each of the following.
    * **(a)** `$X$` is connected.
    * **(b)** `$X$` is path-connected.
    * **(c)** `$X$` is locally path-connected.

2. Let `$p: (Y, y_0)\to (S^1, 1)$` be a connected cover of the circle, let `$G = \pi_1(S^1, \mathbb{Z})$` and let `$H = p_*(\pi_1(Y, y_0))\subset G$`. Then prove or disprove that each of the following conditions guarantee that the based cover is isomorphic to some based cover of the form 
`$$p_n: (S^1, 1)\to (S^1, 1),\\ p_n(z) = z^n$$`
    * __(a)__ the group `$H$` is infinite.
    * __(b)__ the group `$H$` has finite index in the group `$G$`.
    * __(c)__ the group `$H$` is isomorphic as a group to `$G$`.
