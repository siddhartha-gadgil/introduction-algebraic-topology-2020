1. Let `$p: (Y, y_0)\to (X, x_0)$` be a connected cover, let `$G =\pi_1(X, x_0)$` 
and let `$H = p_*(\pi_1(Y, y_0))\subset G$`. Then for each of the following conditions, prove or disprove that
the condition guarantees that for every point `$x_1\in p^{-1}(x_0)$` the based cover `$p: (Y, y_1)\to (X, x_0)$` is isomorphic to
the based cover `$p: (Y, y_0)\to (X, x_0)$`.
    * __(a)__ the group `$H$` is abelian.
    * __(b)__ the group `$H$` is normal in `$G$`.
    * __(c)__ the group `$G$` is abelian.

2. Let `$X$` be a path-connected topological space and consider the space `$Y$` and the map `$p: Y\to X$` constructed in the lectures corresponding to the subgroup `$H = G$`. Prove or disprove each of the following.
    * __(a)__ `$p$` is always a bijection.
    * __(b)__ `$p$` is always continuous.
    * __(c)__ `$p$` is continuous if `$X$` is locally path-connected.
    * __(d)__ the inverse of `$p$` exists and is continuous if `$X$` is locally path-connected.
    * __(e)__ the inverse of `$p$` always exists and is continuous.

3. Let `$(X, x_0)$` be a path-connected based topological space and consider the space `$Y$` and the map `$p: Y\to X$` constructed in the lectures corresponding to the some subgroup `$H \subset G$`. Let `$U$` be a path-connected open subset of `$X$` and let `$U_{\gamma}$` be an associated set 
as in the lectures. Prove or disprove each of the following.
    * __(a)__ `$p\vert_{U_\gamma}: U_\gamma \to U$` is bijective.
    * __(b)__ `$p\vert_{U_\gamma}: U_\gamma \to U$` is continuous.
    * __(c)__ `$p\vert_{U_\gamma}: U_\gamma \to U$` is surjective.
    * __(d)__ `$p\vert_{U_\gamma}: U_\gamma \to U$` has a continuous inverse.
    * __(c)__ `$p\vert_{U_\gamma}: U_\gamma \to U$` is injective.
