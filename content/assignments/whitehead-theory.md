1. For which integers `$n\geq 0$` does every map from the `$n$`-sphere `$S^n$` to the torus `$S^1\times S^1$` extend to a map to the `$(n+1)$`-disc `$D^{n+1}$`. Note that the `$1$`-sphere is the circle and the `$0$`-sphere consists of `$2$` points.

2. Prove or disprove the following.
    - __(a)__ If `$X$` and `$Y$` are Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, so is their product `$X\times Y$`.
    - __(b)__ If `$X$` is an Eilenberg-MacLane space and `$Y$` is a connected cover of `$X$`, then `$Y$` is an Eilenberg-MacLane space.
    - __(c)__ If `$X$` is an Eilenberg-MacLane space and `$X$` is a connected cover of `$Y$`, then `$Y$` is an Eilenberg-MacLane space.

3. Let `$X$` be a CW complex with fundamental group `$\Z/2\Z$`. Determine the number of maps from `$X$` to `$S^1$` up to homotopy (with proof).
