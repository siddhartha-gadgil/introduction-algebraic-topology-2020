<h2>Online lectures</h2>
<p>Lectures are slide-shows consisting of videos (screencasts) mostly alternating with quizzes. You can make the videos full-screen. 
    It is recommended that you watch with "quality" at least 720p to avoid fuzzy writing (click on the setting at the bottom of the YouTube video to specify this).</p>

    <li><a href="../lectures/" target="_blank">Lecture 1:</a> <strong>Introduction.</strong> <p>Here we give an overview of what we study in topology, and formulate what we mean by topological problems. We then clarify what it means to <em>translate</em> a topological problem to an algebraic one, and sketch the approach taken in algebraic topology.</p> </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture2.html" target="_blank">Lecture 2:</a><strong> Paths and Homotopy.</strong>
    <p>At the core of Algebraic topology is a relation between paths, and more generally continuous functions, called <em>homotopy</em>. We introduce paths and <em>multiplication</em> and <em>inverse</em> operations on paths. A key construction is an equivalence relation on paths, <em>homotopy fixing endpoints</em>. Paths up to this equivalence relation have nice algebraic structures, and the collection of paths up to equivalence has a more manageable size. This is based on nice properties of the algebraic operations up to equivalence, which we prove.</p></li> 
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture3.html" target="_blank">Lecture 3:</a><strong> Groupoids.</strong>
    <p>This lecture is a digression introducing and giving examples of an algebraic structure called a <em>groupoid</em>. Groupoids generalizes groups, and are more natural in various contexts. Indeed a further generalization, $\infty$-groupoids (which we do not introduce) are algebraic structures that in some sense are as rich as topological spaces.</p></li> 
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture4.html" target="_blank">Lecture 4:</a><strong> Fundamental Groups; Covering spaces; Path lifting.</strong>
    <p>
        Building on the algebraic operations and their nice properties up to homotopy fixing base points, we define the fundamental group, $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ of a (based) topological space. The fundamental group is the central notion of the core of this course. One of the two main ways of computing fundamental groups is <em>covering spaces</em>, which we introduce. After sketching the key geometric ideas, we prove the first result relating fundamental groups to covering spaces, so called <em>path lifting</em>. Our proof is chosen to generalize easily and illustrate relevant hypothesis.
    </p></li> 
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture5.html" target="_blank">Lecture 5:</a><strong> Homotopy lifting; Fundamental group of the circle.</strong>
    <p>
        We prove a key property relating fundamental groups to covering spaces, that homotopies (fixing end points) lift to homotopies in covers. Using this, we show that $\pi_1(S^1, 1) = \mathbb{Z}$. The proof of the latter also involves using symmetries of the covering map, which we will later formalize and understand as deck transformations.
    </p></li> 
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture6.html" target="_blank">Lecture 6:</a><strong> Functoriality; Based spaces.</strong>
    <p>
        We now establish functorial properties of the fundamental group. The group $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is not a functor on the category of topological spaces, but on <em>based spaces</em>. We define based spaces and see this. On the other hand, the morphisms induced by a based map $f: (X, x_0) \to (Y, y_0)$ depend only on the homotopy class of $f$ as a map between based spaces, i.e., we have a functor on the category where morphisms are homotopy classes of maps. Finally, as we really want to study topological spaces, not based topological spaces, we see how the fundamental group depends on the choice of basepoint. 
    </p></li> 
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture7.html" target="_blank">Lecture 7:</a><strong> Applications.</strong>
    <p>We see two applications of the fundamental group, specifically of $\pi_1(S^1, 1) =\mathbb{Z}$ together with functoriality. The first is the $2$-dimensional <em>Brouwer fixed point theorem</em>, which says that any map $f$ from the $2$-disc to itself has a fixed point. The second is that $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^3$. This involves showing that the fundamental group of $S^2$ is trivial, which involves ideas relevant to understanding the fundamental group of unions.</p></li> 
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture8.html" target="_blank">Lecture 8:</a><strong> More covering maps.</strong>
    <p>We look at more covering maps for the circle - disconnected covers and $n$-fold covers. We will eventually see that the $n$-fold covers, together with the standard cover $p: \mathbb{R} \to S^1$ give all connected covers of the circle, and there is a nice descriptions of all covers of all reasonable spaces. We also prove the first result in this general theory - that covering maps induce injections on the fundamental group.</p></li> 
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture9.html" target="_blank">Lecture 9:</a><strong> Graphs.</strong>
    <p>We introduce graphs (which may contain loops and multiple edges) as combinatorial objects, and associate to them topological spaces called <em>geometric realizations</em>. Further, we define morphisms of graphs, so that geometric realization becomes a functor. Finally, there is a simple combinatorial characterization of when graph morphisms are covering maps. Graphs are very useful for constructing examples of covering spaces, and also for applications of topology to group theory.</p></li> 
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture10.html" target="_blank">Lecture 10:</a><strong> Free Groups.</strong>
    <p>We introduce free groups. These will give us interesting examples. Further as all groups are quotients of free groups, we can define so called <em>presentations</em> of groups. These allow us to describe fundamental groups of most nice enough spaces.</p></li>

<p>
    There will be a few more lectures in the course, on two topics both concerned with working with higher-dimensional structure. The first is a glimpse of <em>Whitehead theory</em>, which tells us that $\pi_1$ together with its higher-dimensional counterparts $\pi_n$, in some sense fully determine homotopy type and homotopy of maps for nice enough spaces. We will define $\pi_n$, prove a couple of properties allowing us to conclude that in some situations $\pi_n$ vanishes for $n\geq 2$, and state and sketch a proof of Whitehead's results that in these cases the groups $\pi_1$ and induced maps on $\pi_1$ determine homotopy and homotopy types.
</p>
<p>
    The second topic we will see briefly is simplicial homology. This will be defined on simplicial complexes and $\Delta$-complexes. It is relatively easy to compute, and carries higher higher-dimensional information. However, it is not <em>a priori</em> invariant under homeomorphisms, and is not functorial.
</p>
<p>
    The most effective way to capture high-dimensional structure, <em>singular homology</em>, will not be introduced in this course.
