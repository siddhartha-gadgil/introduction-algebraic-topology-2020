<p>Lectures are slide-shows consisting of videos (screencasts) mostly alternating with quizzes. You can make the videos
    full-screen.
    It is recommended that you watch with "quality" at least 720p to avoid fuzzy writing (click on the setting at the

    <li><a href="../lectures/" target="_blank">Lecture 1:</a> <strong>Introduction.</strong>
        <p>Here we give an overview of what we study in topology, and formulate what we mean by topological problems. We
            then clarify what it means to <em>translate</em> a topological problem to an algebraic one, and sketch the
            approach taken in algebraic topology.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture2.html" target="_blank">Lecture 2:</a><strong> Paths and Homotopy.</strong>
        <p>At the core of Algebraic topology is a relation between paths, and more generally continuous functions,
            called <em>homotopy</em>. We introduce paths and <em>multiplication</em> and <em>inverse</em> operations on
            paths. A key construction is an equivalence relation on paths, <em>homotopy fixing endpoints</em>. Paths up
            to this equivalence relation have nice algebraic structures, and the collection of paths up to equivalence
            has a more manageable size. This is based on nice properties of the algebraic operations up to equivalence,
            which we prove.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture3.html" target="_blank">Lecture 3:</a><strong> Groupoids.</strong>
        <p>This lecture is a digression introducing and giving examples of an algebraic structure called a
            <em>groupoid</em>. Groupoids generalizes groups, and are more natural in various contexts. Indeed a further
            generalization, $\infty$-groupoids (which we do not introduce) are algebraic structures that in some sense
            are as rich as topological spaces.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture4.html" target="_blank">Lecture 4:</a><strong> Fundamental Groups; Covering spaces;
            Path lifting.</strong>
        <p>
            Building on the algebraic operations and their nice properties up to homotopy fixing base points, we define
            the fundamental group, $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ of a (based) topological space. The fundamental group is the central
            notion of the core of this course. One of the two main ways of computing fundamental groups is <em>covering
                spaces</em>, which we introduce. After sketching the key geometric ideas, we prove the first result
            relating fundamental groups to covering spaces, so called <em>path lifting</em>. Our proof is chosen to
            generalize easily and illustrate relevant hypothesis.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture5.html" target="_blank">Lecture 5:</a><strong> Homotopy lifting; Fundamental group
            of the circle.</strong>
        <p>
            We prove a key property relating fundamental groups to covering spaces, that homotopies (fixing end points)
            lift to homotopies in covers. Using this, we show that $\pi_1(S^1, 1) = \Z$. The proof of the latter also
            involves using symmetries of the covering map, which we will later formalize and understand as deck
            transformations.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture6.html" target="_blank">Lecture 6:</a><strong> Functoriality; Based spaces.</strong>
        <p>
            We now establish functorial properties of the fundamental group. The group $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is not a functor
            on the category of topological spaces, but on <em>based spaces</em>. We define based spaces and see this. On
            the other hand, the morphisms induced by a based map $f: (X, x_0) \to (Y, y_0)$ depend only on the homotopy
            class of $f$ as a map between based spaces, i.e., we have a functor on the category where morphisms are
            homotopy classes of maps. Finally, as we really want to study topological spaces, not based topological
            spaces, we see how the fundamental group depends on the choice of basepoint.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture7.html" target="_blank">Lecture 7:</a><strong> Applications.</strong>
        <p>We see two applications of the fundamental group, specifically of $\pi_1(S^1, 1) =\Z$ together with
            functoriality. The first is the $2$-dimensional <em>Brouwer fixed point theorem</em>, which says that any
            map $f$ from the $2$-disc to itself has a fixed point. The second is that $\R^2$ is not homeomorphic to
            $\R^3$. This involves showing that the fundamental group of $S^2$ is trivial, which involves ideas relevant
            to understanding the fundamental group of unions.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture8.html" target="_blank">Lecture 8:</a><strong> More covering maps.</strong>
        <p>We look at more covering maps for the circle - disconnected covers and $n$-fold covers. We will eventually
            see that the $n$-fold covers, together with the standard cover $p: \R \to S^1$ give all connected covers of
            the circle, and there is a nice descriptions of all covers of all reasonable spaces. We also prove the first
            result in this general theory - that covering maps induce injections on the fundamental group.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture9.html" target="_blank">Lecture 9:</a><strong> Graphs.</strong>
        <p>We introduce graphs (which may contain loops and multiple edges) as combinatorial objects, and associate to
            them topological spaces called <em>geometric realizations</em>. Further, we define morphisms of graphs, so
            that geometric realization becomes a functor. Finally, there is a simple combinatorial characterization of
            when graph morphisms are covering maps. Graphs are very useful for constructing examples of covering spaces,
            and also for applications of topology to group theory.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture10.html" target="_blank">Lecture 10:</a><strong> Free Groups.</strong>
        <p>We introduce free groups. These will give us interesting examples. Further as all groups are quotients of
            free groups, we can define so called <em>presentations</em> of groups. These allow us to describe
            fundamental groups of most nice enough spaces.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture11.html" target="_blank">Lecture 11:</a><strong> Fundamental groups, Trees and Free
            groups.</strong>
        <p>
            We construct spaces with fundamental groups free groups on a given set of generators. The proof that the
            fundamental group is free involves studying a specific class of graphs, <em>Trees</em>, and proving that
            these are contractible. The proof we give for contractibility of trees is a special case of methods of
            Whitehead, which are applicable in much greater generality, and our goal is to illustrate these methods.
            Given contractibility of the tree, the rest of the proof involves ideas similar to those used for the
            fundamental group of the circle, as well as an interplay between group theory and topology. As a consequence
            we obtain a topological proof of an algebraic result concerning the free group.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture12.html" target="_blank">Lecture 12:</a><strong> Map lifting.</strong>
        <p>The <em>map lifting</em> theorem says that the lifting problem for a covering map has a solution if and only
            if the corresponding lifting problem on groups obtained by passing to fundamental groups has a solution,
            provided the spaces involved are reasonable. We prove this and give an application. Map lifting will also be
            used in the classification of covering spaces.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture13.html" target="_blank">Lecture 13:</a><strong> Isomorphisms of based
            covers.</strong>
        <p>We begin the classification of covering maps for reasonable spaces, concretely connected, locally
            path-connected and <em>semi-locally simply connected</em> spaces. The first step is to prove that a based
            covering map is determined by the subgroup of the fundamental group, which we do in this lecture. We also
            describe the fibre of the based cover in terms of the fundamental group of the base and its subgroup
            corresponding to the cover.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture14.html" target="_blank">Lecture 14:</a><strong> Isomorphisms of covers and Deck
            transformations.</strong>
        <p>From the classification of based covers we obtain a classification of covers by understanding the dependence
            on base points. Further, we get a description of symmetries of covers, which are called <em>deck
                transformations</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture15.html" target="_blank">Lecture 15:</a><strong> Spaces without Universal
            covers.</strong>
        <p>Here we see examples of spaces that do not have covers corresponding to certain subgroups of the fundamental
            groups. This lets us identify te condition of <em>semi-local simple connectivity</em> needed fot the
            existence of covers.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture16.html" target="_blank">Lecture 16:</a><strong> Galois theory for covering
            spaces.</strong>
        <p>We complete the classification of covering maps and their symmetries, so called <em>Galois theory for
                coverings</em>. Uniqueness was shown earlier. The goal of this lecture is to construct covers and show
            that they have the required properties.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture17.html" target="_blank">Lecture 17:</a><strong> Free products and the Seifert-Van
            Kampen theorem.</strong>
        <p>The Seifert-Van Kampen theorem gives the fundamental group of a union of spaces in terms of their fundamental
            groups, provided various intersections are path-connected. The fundamental group of the union $X$ is the
            quotient of the so called <em>free product</em>. We introduce and construct free products, and construct and
            prove the surjectivity of a homomorphism from the free product onto $\pi_1(X)$. Finally, we discuss the
            categorical product and co-product constructions, as free products are co-products.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture18.html" target="_blank">Lecture 18:</a><strong> The Seifert-Van Kampen
            theorem.</strong>
        <p>We now state and prove the Seifert-Van Kampen theorem, giving the fundamental groups of unions of spaces.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture19.html" target="_blank">Lecture 19:</a><strong> Graphs and the Fenchel-Nielsen
            Theorem.</strong>
        <p>As an application of the Seifert-Van Kampen theorem, we show that the fundamental group of any graph is free.
            As a consequence, we obtain a group theoretic result called the Fenchel-Nielsen theorem, which states that
            any subgroup of a free group is isomorphic to a free group.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture20.html" target="_blank">Lecture 20:</a><strong> Two-complexes and
            Surfaces.</strong>
        <p>
            Most familiar spaces can be obtained inductively by a process called <em>attaching cells</em>, which we
            formalize. We show the effect of attaching cells on the fundamental group. As a consequence, we show that
            every group is the fundamental group of a topological space. We also describe the fundamental group of
            surfaces.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture21.html" target="_blank">Lecture 21:</a><strong> Topological proof of Grushko's
            theorem (due to Stallings).</strong>
        <p>
            Using topological methods, Stallings gave a beautiful proof of the following algebraic result: Given a free
            group $F$, groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ and a surjection $\varphi: F \to G_1 * G_2$, there is decomposition $F =
            F_1 * F_2$ such that $\varphi(F_i) = G_i$. We sketch a proof of this result. The videos in this lecture were
            made several years ago.
        </p>

    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture22.html" target="_blank">Lecture 22:</a><strong> CW complexes.</strong>
        <p>
            A <em>CW complex</em> is a space that is inductively obtained by attaching cells. Most familiar spaces can
            be described as CW complexes. As discovered by Whitehead (who defined CW complexes), these are very well
            suited for studying homotopy theory, and specifically for showing that in some context algebraic topology
            determines the homotopy type.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture23.html" target="_blank">Lecture 23:</a><strong> Higher homotopy groups.</strong>
        <p>
            Higher homotopy groups $\pi_n(X, x_0)$ are higher-dimensional analogues of the fundamental groups, given by
            maps from cubes relative to their boundaries (or equivalently by maps from spheres with a basepoint). We
            define these and show that they form a group.
        </p>
        <p>
            We prove two properties of higher-homotopy groups that are easy to show but important (and perhaps
            surprising). These are that higher homotopy groups are abelian, and that covers induce isomorphisms on
            higher homotopy groups.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture24.html" target="_blank">Lecture 24:</a><strong> Higher homotopy groups, Extension problems
        and Contractibility.</strong>
        <p>
            We prove the first results that show how homotopy groups control homotopy type. Specifically, the vanishing
            of homotopy groups is equivalent to all extension problems of maps from spheres to maps from discs they
            bound have solutions. As a consequence a CW-complex is contractible if and only if its homotopy groups
            coincide with those of a point.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture25.html" target="_blank">Lecture 25:</a><strong> Eilenberg-MacLane spaces and
            Whitehead's theorem.</strong>
        <p>
            Eilenberg-MacLane spaces are CW complexes whose higher homotopy groups vanish. Theorems of Whitehead say
            that the homotopy type of such a space is determined by its fundamental groups, and maps to such spaces are
            determined up to homotopy by the induced maps on $\pi_1$. We sketch proofs of these results.

    <li><a href="../lectures/lecture26.html" target="_blank">Lecture 26:</a><strong> On Homotopy groups and Homology
            groups.</strong>
        <p>
            This lecture largely consists of general remarks, first explaining (without proofs) why higher homotopy
            groups are complicated, and how homology is related to these, and then sketching how simplicial homology is
            defined.

            homology.</strong>
        <p>
            We define <em>simplicial complexes</em>, which are spaces obtained by gluing vertices, edges, triangles,
            tetrahedra and their higher dimensional analogues in a rigid fashion. These have a purely combinatorial
            description, and have associated to them topological spaces.

            We conclude the course with some examples of computing simplicial homology, including by using so called
            $\Delta$-complexes which are more flexible than simplicial complexes but on which simplicial homology can be
            defined.
