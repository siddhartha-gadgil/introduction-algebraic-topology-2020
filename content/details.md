#### Course Details
  
* __Instructor:__ [Siddhartha Gadgil](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil)
* __E-mail:__ _siddhartha.gadgil@gmail.com_
* __Teaching Assistant:__ Sumanta Das

This course will be taught online, mostly through pre-recorded [lectures](./all-lectures/). There will also be interactive sessions on Microsoft Teams.

##### Microsoft Teams details

A Team for this course (within IISc) named _Introduction to Algebraic Topology 2020-2021_ has been created. A link to join this Team is posted on the IISc intranet (under Department of Mathematics), and people from IISc can also join using the Team code _d0b3gvb_. Please join the Team if you register for the course or wish to attend interactive sessions. If you choose to leave the course after some lectures you can leave the Team.

Please download the appropriate Teams app before the first interactive session. There are Apps available for Windows, Linux (Debian/Ubuntu and Redhat), Mac, Android and iOS. Once you have joined the team, whenever I (or someone else) starts a meeting  you will see in the chat that a meeting has started. Please click to join.

The initial timings for the interactive sessions are __Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 8:00 am - 9:00 am__. Since the bulk of the course will be through pre-recorded lectures, after October 15 we may reduce meeting times. The first meeting will be at __8:00 am__ on __Friday, October 2, 2020__.

I would encourage using the Teams chat when it is set up to ask questions whenever needed. We will also meet for interactive sessions.

##### Assignment submissions

Assignments will be posted on this web site and linked in Microsoft Teams. They have to be submitted through Microsoft Teams.

##### Alternative chat

I have also set up a [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/siddhartha-gadgil/introduction-algebraic-topology-2020) channel,
which has the advantage of TeX support and not requiring an IISc account, but needs an account in one of Twitter, Github and GitLab to sign in.

#### Examinations and Grades

Due to the difficulty of online evaluation, there will be 3 term examinations as well as a final examination. These will all be written, followed by an oral section where the student must be able to explain anything in the written proof, well enough to establish to my satisfaction that the student wrote this based on understanding, not by copying. Suspicion of copying will be strongly penalized.

Grades will be based on the  assignments, midterm examinations and final examinations with the following weightages.

* __Assignments:__ 10%
* __Midterm 1:__ 15%
* __Midterm 2:__ 25%
* __Midterm 3:__ 20%
* __Final exam:__ 30%
