#### Course Details
  
* __Instructor:__ [Siddhartha Gadgil](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil)
* __E-mail:__ _siddhartha.gadgil@gmail.com_

This course will be taught online, mostly through pre-recorded [lectures](./all-lectures/). There will also be interactive sessions on Microsoft Teams.
Details of the _Team_ will be posted as they become clear. There may be a _Team_ created automatically for each course with the registered students or
I may create this manually. Those auditing should contact me, but __after__ you see updates here saying that a _Team_ has been created.

I would encourage using the Teams chat when it is set up to ask questions whenever needed. I have also set up a [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/siddhartha-gadgil/introduction-algebraic-topology-2020) channel,
which has the advantage of TeX support and not requiring an IISc account, but needs an account in one of Twitter, Github and GitLab to sign in.

Assignments will be posted here and linked in Microsoft Teams. They have to be submitted through Microsoft Teams.

##### Timings

The official timings are __Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 8:00 am - 9:00 am__. Since the bulk of the course will be through pre-recorded lectures, in practice we may meet for only a subset of the meeting times. The first meeting will be at __8:00 am__ on __Friday, October 2, 2020__ on Microsoft Teams.

#### Examinations

Due to the difficulty of online evaluation, there will be 3 term examinations as well as a final examination. These will all be written, followed by an oral section where the student must be able to explain anything in the written proof, well enough to establish to my satisfaction that the student wrote this based on understanding, not by copying. Suspicion of copying will be strongly penalized.
