## Quiz 23.2

Fix $n\geq 1$, let $D = [0, 1]^n$ and let P = $D\setminus\{(1/2, 1/2, \dots, 1/2)\}$. Then $\pi_n(X, x_0)$ is abelian for all based spaces $(X, x_0)$ if and only if

## Quiz 27.1

Fix $n\geq 1$ and consider the partially ordered set $$S = \{k\in \mathbb{N}: k\vert n\}$$
where $k\vert n$ means $k$ divides $n$, with the partial order given by $k\leq m$ if $k\vert m$. Let $X$ be the Poset complex associated to S. Which of the following is true.

## Quiz 27.2

Let $$\Sigma=\{\{0\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{0, 1\}, \{0, 2\}\}.$$
Then to which of the following spaces is the geometric realization $X =\vert\Sigma\vert$ homeomorphic?

## Quiz 28.1

Let $$\Sigma=\{\{0\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{0, 1\}, \{0, 2\}\}.$$  The abelian groups $C_1$ and $Z_1$ are called the groups of 1-chains and 1-cycles respectively.

## Explanation

Let $$X = \{(0, y): y\in [-1, 1]\}\cup \{(x, \sin(\pi/x)): x \in (0, 1]\}$$ be the topologists sine curve and let $Y$, the quasi-circle, be the quotient of $X$ identifying $(0, 0)$ with $(1, 0)$. Then we have a projection map from $X$ to $[0, 1]$ given by $(x, y)\mapsto y$. This induces the _projection_ from $Y$ to the quotient of $[0,1]$ with endpoints identified, which is the circle.
